# BayesWorkshop2026
This respository is for shared materials for the 2026 Bayesian statistics workshop in Abuja, Nigeria. Workshop participants should fork this repository to their github user accounts.

## Before the workshop:


-----

### 1. Set up your system.

| Task | Materials |
|------| ---------|
| 1. Install and configure software.|  [Setup Instructions Part 1](setupinstructions/SetupInstructionsPart1.md)
| 2. Install R packages for Bayesian data analysis | [Setup Intructions Part 2](setupinstructions/SetupInstructionsPart2.md)|
| 3. Set up an R Project with a GitHub repository | [Setup Instructions Part 3](setupinstructions/SetupInstructionsPart3.md)

### 2. Learn some R fundamentals. [Rmodule1](Rmodule1)

|Task| Materials |
|----| ----------|
| 1. Read *You Can Learn R* by Sam Manski. |[You_Can_Learn_R.pdf](Rmodule1/You_Can_Learn_R.pdf)|
| 2. Do some practice exercises developed by Sam Manski. *Open each script in R Studio and follow the instructions in the code. Write your answers into the code and commit to your GitHub repository.*. |1. [GettingStarted.R](Rmodule1/Exercises/GettingStarted.R) |
|  | 2. [LearnR.Rmd](Rmodule1/Exercises/LearnR.Rmd)|
|  | 3. [Errors.Rmd](Rmodule1/Exercises/Errors.Rmd)|

#### Additional resources to learn R fundamentals:
Many of these include practice exercises.
- R for Gradaute Students (https://bookdown.org/yih_huynh/Guide-to-R-Book/)
- R for Data Science (https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) 
- RStudio education page (https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/) 
- Posit Recipes (https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes)

### 3. Write some R sample code. [Rmodule2](Rmodule2)

A good way to build your R coding skills is to create a portfolio of code that you draw from and adapt for different projects. For this module, you will write a set of R scripts that perform useful analysis tasks. The repository contains two example scripts, [sampleModularScript1.R](Rmodule2/sampleModularScript1.R) and [sampleModularScript2.R](Rmodule2/sampleModularScript2.R), that illustrate how to separate tasks into modular scripts that work together. This good practice for building complex data analysis workflows in R or any other language.   

Come up with at least five R coding tasks that would be useful for your work (feel free to choose from the list below). Save the code into one or more scripts with descriptive names into the Rmodule2 folder (remember to commit and push!). Add comments describing what the code does. Use whatever help resources you like. The [Posit Recipes page](https://posit.cloud/learn/recipes) might be useful.

  
#### Sample coding tasks:

- Read a CSV data file into your R session and inspect its contents. 
- Visualize data in a scatterplot.
- Create a function.
- Run a function you have created.
- Create a table by hand.
- Calculate summary statistics for a table. 
- Add a column to a table calculated from columns present in the data.

#### Coding tasks with a more Bayesian flavor:
- Simulate a coin flip.
- Generate a random sample on a standard normal distribution.
- Plot a histogram of your random sample.
